//The project is a part of "Introduction to programming in C++" course. 

This project is a quiz game in the style of `Who wants to be a millionaire`.

The player can choose between 3 categories - Bulgarian history, Bulgarian geography or Bulgarian sport. Additionally a game with all categories could be played.
The player has to answer 15 multiple-choice questions with increasing difficulty. There are 10 levels of difficulty. Each correct answer increases the final cash price. If at any stage the player answers incorrectly, the game ends.

There are 3 lifelines:
- 50:50 - two of the three incorrect answers are removed with radnom selection.
- Phone a friend - represents an answer from a friend. 
- Ask the public - represents a voting audience. The percent of the correct votes decreases while the difficulty of the questions increases.
Only one lifeline can be used on a question and each lifeline may only be used once during an entire game.

Outside of the game, the user can add new questions and edit exsisting ones.
